                            The app version is important to allow us to know
                            what version an error or crash occurs on, as well

                        Knowing how many articles you have lets us make sure we're
                        developing the right UI to show all those items in the best
                        was possible. This means ensuring it's fast (more items,
                        means a different approach to making it fast) &amp; readable
                        (fewer items? Different layout).

                        left hand menu. If we see people have fewer, we might
                        choose to change how we present that information.

                        is determined by this. If it's lots, and slow, maybe we need
                        background sync. If it's not, maybe we should sync more often.

                        we need to focus on that part of the app, verus managing your
