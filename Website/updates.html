                <li>Windows Timeline support -- see what you've been reading, and when you read it. Just click the Windows Task View icon</li>
                <li>Picture-in-picture mode! Need to keep the article on screen while working in other applications? This is it!</li>

                <li>Many more keyboard shortcuts! See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for details. You'll also see them mentioned in tooltips now!</li>

                <li>Improved startup performance when restoring directly back to an article</li>
                <li>Improved keyboard focus so that it doesn't get lost, and goes exactly where you'd expect it to</li>
                <li>Added a footer to the article to let you share, delete, like and perform other operations when you're at the end without showing the toolbar</li>
                <li>Toolbar overflow in the article view, so it's not quite so busy</li>
            </ul>

                <li>With Windows 10 v1809 you could unintentionally zoom the UI with a wheel &amp; Ctrl+ -- it's now disabled</li>

                <li>Double clicking 'close' to close an article would crash</li>
                <li>Sometimes, images were draggable. You didn't want them to be, so now they're not!</li>
