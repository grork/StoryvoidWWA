            A Windows 10 UWP app that lets you read articles you've saved to
            your <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> account. It
            syncs articles locally for offline reading, and lets you do all the
            things you'd expect an Instapaper app to do:
            <ul>
                <li>Different colour schemes</li>
                <li>Archiving, Liking, & placing items in folders</li>
                <li>Select from different type faces, sizes, colours, and spacing</li>
                <li>Full screen viewing for a more immersive reading experience</li>

            If you're having problems with how the article looks in the app, it
            really helps if you include both the URL of the article, and a
            screen shot of what's not right.
